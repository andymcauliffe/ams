# ams

Autonomous Music Synthesis is my thesis-equivalent project in support of my
bid for a Master of Science degree in computer science from the University
of Nebraska at Omaha. This video is my presentation of the project and the
first part of the defense. AMS is a computer program that randomly generates
meh-sounding melodies and then uses artificial intelligence techniques to
make them sound better.
